<p>Splish splash I’m taking a bath! Stop bothering me to write your blog posts! <i>*whispers*</i> Wait, this needs to get out now? <i>*whispers*</i> Alright, I’ll see what I can do...</p>

<p><i>*ahem*</i>, Because of the growing headaches with our weapons and hats disintegrating or causing fifth degree burns, we have made the choice to focus this year on improving the systems that provide you with that new inventory. <b>Our talented engineers will be tinkering around the clock for the coming months to make Creators.TF an overall better experience</b>, which you’ll be able to follow via our <a href='' target='_blank'>Trello Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Now before you go into a frenzied panic, this does not mean we will be cancelling current and upcoming events. You will still be able to quench your need for robot slaying till September 1st, after which, Digital Directive will be partially retired, with servers and loot still provided.</p>

<p>The two remaining holiday events, <b>Halloween and Smissmas will continue</b> as planned. We also encourage you, disturbingly creative folk, to continue submitting your ghoulish or jolly ideas to our <a href='' target='_blank'>workshop</a>.</p>

<p>If the prospect of holidays and system maintenance doesn't excite you, then we have one last upcoming feature to talk about, Vanilla+ Servers!  Not everyone wants to play the game with a myriad of new things mixed in - and that’s okay... really, no feelings hurt <i>*cocks shotgun*</i>.</p>

<p>Alongside our existing Creators.TF custom servers and the MvM servers, <b>we will additionally be hosting vanilla TF2 servers</b> amongst the various regions, with the  “+” coming from our gameplay fixes, the curated map pool, and seeding capabilities you already see in action today. We’re working on these servers at the moment, and they should be released for mass consumption in a few weeks.</p>

<p>In the meantime, check out the latest Digital Directive mission rebalances in today’s <a href='/blog/111'>patch notes</a>.</p>
