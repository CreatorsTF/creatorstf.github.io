<p>An update for Creators.TF servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Notable changes include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hypodermic Injector
		<ul>
			<li>Reduced healing required to build a charge from 450 to 350.<br/>
			<li>Increased healing done on hit from 120 to 180.<br/>
			<li>Increased buff duration from 2.5 seconds to 4 seconds.<br/><br/>
			<i>Why: The injector often made medics go for a clutch play trying to save a teammate, which was very risky. However, the reward didn't reflect the time needed to build and what you got off of it. The effects didn't last long enough for anyone to truly catch the effect being applied, and the healing was equal or less to that of 2 crossbow arrows which can be fired from a safe distance. The lowered amount of healing needed to be done, and the added health combined with the longer duration, adds up for the increased risk of using this weapon. Better balancing the high risk vs high reward aspect of the weapon.</i><br/><br/></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
