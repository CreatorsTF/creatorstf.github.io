<p>Let me ask you this son, do you like Christmas presents underneath the tree and opening them in front of your loving family? Well good for you, because I've never had that experience as a kid.</p>

<p>On a warmer note, today’s briefing includes the magnificent loot you get as a result of your hard work out on the battlefield. It might not be pretty, it might look like a lump of sad metal looking for a family (like me), but it’ll have to do since we’ve already blown the budget 17 times over.</p>

<p>Check out what we have in store for you on the <a href='/landing/digitaldirective/medalofhonor' target='_blank'>Day 3 update page</a>!</p>
