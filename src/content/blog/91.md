Good <i>[SPECIFY_TIME_HERE_MEATBAG]</i> Mercenaries!
Today’s update is a doozy, <b>because we’ve got three crates of content for the price of one blog post!</b></br></br>
First things first: we’re announcing a <u><b>Closed Beta Test</b></u> for our upcoming event!</br>
<ul>
<li> From today to Wednesday, March 31st, patrons will receive a closed beta access ticket in their Creators.TF inventory allowing them to join and queue for what's to come! If you are a patron, follow the steps shown on our <a href='https://www.patreon.com/creatorstf/posts' target='_blank'>latest post on patreon</a> to receive a ticket.</br>
<li> Following that, from April 1st to April 4th, the beta test will then be opened to a wider range of community members. Stay tuned in the coming days on our <a href='' target="_blank">Discord</a> for how to obtain an access ticket during this time.
</ul>

If you’re not already a patron, you can sign up through our <a href='' target="_blank">Donate</a> page and pledge any amount. Then, follow the steps on our <a href='https://www.patreon.com/creatorstf/posts' target='_blank'>latest post on patreon</a>, which is only viewable by patrons, and you'll receive access to the closed beta! Once a beta ticket is received, simply click the <a href='/quickplay' target="_blank">Find a Server</a> button, and help us test the incoming rush for the rest of our mercenaries.</br></br>
<i>By helping us test new content, you’re making sure that our engineers haven’t left any critical bugs and that our servers
won’t crash and burn on release.</i>

<h3>Map Rotation Shakeup</h3>
<p>
Next up! <b>It’s time yet again for a map rotation shakeup!</b></br></br>
For this shakeup, we decided to travel back to some of the classics that we all know and love,
but also introduce some fresh new death zones that you can poke around and splatter blood and buckets of guts all over.</br></br>
Wanting to get a rush of nostalgia? Why not head back to some of the well known classics like <b>Dustbowl, Freight, Highpass, Powerhouse and Steel?</b>
We also have a great community map, <b>Cascade</b>, joining our rotation!</br></br>
As always, we welcome your feedback about the map rotation on our <a href='' target='_blank'>Discord</a>.

<h3>New Project Lead</h3>
<p>
And now, <b>an incoming transmission from Creators.TF new Project Lead, Nanochip:</b>
</p>
<p class="quoteFromSomeone">
"Hello everyone. For those who don’t know who I am, my name is Nanochip. I have been managing and leading the project internally since the middle of January. Moonly Days has designated me in this position so that we can make sure future events are released smoothly without issues.</br></br>
A lot has happened in the past few months, both with the servers themselves and the internal structuring of our team. This has been in response to all the lessons we learned during last year. Furthermore, expect to see much more communication from the team moving forward.</br></br>
Moonly's role as Lead Developer has not changed, he still is the creator and founder of Creators.TF. However from this point on, I will publicly bear the responsibility of leading the project and the outreach with the community, including the delegation of tasks to each team member and coordinating deadlines.</br></br>
The next big event is just around the corner. I can't wait to show you all what we've been working on for the past few months. If you wish to contact me, I can be reached at <a href='mailto:nanochip@creators.tf'>nanochip@creators.tf</a> or poke me in the Discord."</br></br>

That’s all we have in store for this triple-flavor-fruit burst of an update, see you guys locked and loaded out on the battlefield!</br></br></br></br>
Wait a second... Hey! Who left <a href="/landing/smithereens" target="_blank">this letter lying around? Get rid of it!</a>
