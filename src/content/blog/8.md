<p>After some postponing, and because Santa wanted a rest, the Self-Made Smissmas event has come to an end. Thanks to everyone who played it!</p>

<p>We're currently aiming for the first week of February to release the next event, which will be themed around vanilla Team Fortress 2 content. This one will also, of course, include new contracts, maps, cosmetics and some new features, such as the ability to scrap items (This one was highly requested by you!) Yes, your inventory will finally be clean and organized.</p>

<p>If you are the author of an item or map for Team Fortress 2 and want to see it in our servers - submit it via our form on the right side of the website. See you soon!</p>
