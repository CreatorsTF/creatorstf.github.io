<i>SAXTON HALE,</i><br><br>
Hahahaha. You really think you’re something aren’t you? A big tough Australian man in a big skyscraper out in the middle of nowhere who has a baby for a brain.<br><br>
I’ll tell ya something you old crook, your words mean nothing to me. They meant so little to me that I framed your strongly-worded letter that came right off the press and I hung it up on my wall.
I proceeded to smash that frame with a sledgehammer, and the pieces of glass and wood that remained were discarded in the fire that’s currently making my new and improved <b>ROBOTS</b>.<br><br>
I’m sure that the Russian meatbag, Boston boy, German doofus, and that wannabe Frenchman are gonna be just fine out on the battlefield. This is war Saxton, <a href="/security" target="_blank">and the clock is counting down.</a><br>
</p>

<p>
I would wish you good luck, but I don’t think you deserve it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Your obedient servant,</i><br>
<b>GRAY MANN.</b>
