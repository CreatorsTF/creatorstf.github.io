<p>Before our next update launches, one of the biggest pieces of feedback we've recieved is that we need more volunteer moderators to keep up with the rising demand. Well, this post is designed to address that.</p>
<p>If you've got tons of experience under your belt, or if you're just wanting to help out, you can apply to help moderate the Discord or Game Servers today!<br />
You can apply to be a volunteer moderator by filling out <b><a href="">this form.</a></b></p>
<p>For anything else, <a href="">join the Discord</a> or email <b>support@creators.tf</b> if you have questions or concerns.</p>
