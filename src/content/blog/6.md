<p>Every year in TF2, players look forward to the annual Smissmas update, as it holds a special place in their hearts. Because of this, we thought, "Screw it, let's make our own!"</p>

<p>Introducing the <a href='/landing/selfmadesmissmas'>Self-Made Smissmas event</a>! This is the first event we've ever released, and hopefully you enjoy it as much as we do, because we really like it! This event has been made possible due to a ton of work from the developers, the potted plant, Source modders, and artists, of the Creators.TF team. We've been so busy with this that we hadn't even decided on a name for the update until it was practically finished. It's okay though, who needs a good name when the content can speak for itself?</p>

<p>There have been many hints and teasers of this update, so if you're even <i>remotely</i> interested in seeing those and much more, you can join us in our official <a href="">Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>We very much look forward to working with the community to implement fun, new, and interesting content in 2020. Happy Smissmas and Happy New Year!</p>

<p>- Creators.TF Team</p>
