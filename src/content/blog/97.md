<p>So, Digital Directive huh? If you’re thinking that this is some weird technology-infused hiking trail, then you’d be completely wrong! Hiking is for babies, walking is for big, strong men!</p>

<p>Today’s briefing notes for our campaign include some of the more technical changes that you men will have to face out in that robotic wilderness. You may think that we’re entirely in the dust, but we’ve got some snazzy magic tricks up our sleeves that are sure to make Gray Mann go up in a puff of smoke!</p>

<p>File yourselves into the briefing room, and start reading the <a href='/digitaldirective/augmentations' target='_blank'>Day 2 update page</a>!</p>
