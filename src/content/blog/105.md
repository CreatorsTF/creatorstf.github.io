<p>An update for Digital Directive Mann Vs. Machine servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:</p>
<ul>
<b>Mechachievements:</b>
<li>Fixed "Robotic Revenge" not accepting New Zealium Frontier Justices.</li>
<li>Fixed the logic for "Evade and Cower" to properly work with Spy.</li>
<li>"Destroy 3 Giant Medics with the Big Earner" in "Evade and Cower" now works with all medics instead of just Uber Medics.</li>
<li>Spectators will no longer receive any logic events for Mechachievements.</li>
<li><span tooltip="This bug was a real pain in the ass to track down. In the contracts plugin, I added a brand new restriction type that restricts the contract to all weapons that are under one slot (e.g melee weapons). I originally used a bunch of if-statements for each slot, but that looked really ugly, so I used a for loop with two arrays and did my comparison that way. Turns out, that didn't work at all! After hours of crying after testing with one of our amazing Game Mods (TheSpookiestUser) and completing a full wave as Demoknight, we're now able to have this contract FINALLY fixed. Only 20 more to go... <br>-ZoNiCaL">Fixed "I Don't Need Yer Fancy Tools!" not working with all Demo melee weapons.</span></li>
