<p>After much, much feedback about our map rotation <i>(1k+ votes!)</i>, we are here to shake up our rotation and introduce new stuff!<br>
Starting from the beginning, we are disabling the Hazardous Environments campaign, it was a long run, it's time to say goodbye.<br>
Based on votes, we're removing Steel, Granary and Dustbowl from the rotation and introducing the top voted maps of each mode, along with some pro/summer variants. The results are 7 new official maps: Mercenary Park, Mossrock, Sunshine, Lakeside, Suijin and Borneo. Along with 6 community-made recreations of official maps: Harvest Alpine, Product, Badwater Pro, Barnblitz Pro, Powerhouse Fix and Summercoast.<br>
As usual, contracts for these maps are available to complete right now on our ConTracker!</p>

<p>We are also introducing some new features. The following commands are available to be typed in the in-game chat to allow for easier direct access to our features:
	<li>!l (that's an L) - Opens your current class loadout.</li>
	<li>!w - Opens the website's main page.</li>
	<li>!s - Opens the servers page.</li>
	<li>!c - Opens your ConTracker.</li>
	<li>!i - Opens your Inventory.</li>
	<li>!p - Opens your Creators.TF profile.</li><br>
In order for these commands to work, you must have HTML MOTDs enabled by making sure <i>cl_disablehtmlmotd 0</i> is set in your console (~).<br>
Along with all of that, we are introducing some quality-of-life updates to the gameplay, based on <a href="https://github.com/ldesgoui/tf2-comp-fixes" target="_blank">"TF2 comp fixes"</a> by twiikuu. All of them are carefully listed on the <a href="/blog/46">patch notes</a>.
