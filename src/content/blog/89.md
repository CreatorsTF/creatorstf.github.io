<p>
An update for Creators.TF servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Minor changes include:
	<ul>
		<li>Limited simultaneous connections on one server from the same IP address to no more than 4 separate steam accounts.</li>
		<li>Server !hop has been removed for better performance optimization. Instead, we recommend checking out the servers page via steam overlay.</li>
		<li>Sentry gun upgrade animation is now smooth.</li>
		<li>Added a chance for competitive pregame music to play instead of casual pregame music.</li>
		<li>Added !vkick command to easily call a votekick. Typing <i>!vkick [partial name]</i> will call a vote to kick that player. <br>EX: <i>!vkick nano</i>
		<li>Added the Balance-inator" cosmetic - the winning submission for balancemod.tf's cosmetic creation content.
		<ul>
			<li>All players who have played on Creators.TF x Balancemod Servers before 1/14/2021 have received a Vintage Balance-inator as a thank you for playing Balancemod.</i>
		</ul>
	</ul>
