<p>Well well well, looks like I'm back on blog writin' duty, fellers.</p>

<p>It's yer ol' Texas technician Dell here - that crazy fella who usually writes for y'all asked me to take over so he could &ldquo;take another bath&rdquo;.
Lucky for him, his brain can&rsquo;t even begin to comprehend what&rsquo;s being goin&rsquo; on in the labs.</p>
<p>While Digital Directive was a hard fought battle for the team, it&rsquo;s been mighty fine for me.
Between killing them brainless bucket of bolt robots with mah sentries and drinking from cases of beer,
I&rsquo;ve been able to perform more in-depth research in them fancy weapon-systems the old coot&rsquo;s crammed into his new n&rsquo; improved killin machines.
I gotta&rsquo; admit, Gray Mann has really stepped up his game when it comes up with interestin&rsquo; ways to kill us.</p>

<p>Our first piece of work: A Brick. Made from hardened clay, melted together at over 1,000 degrees Celsius, supposedly infused with blood -&nbsp;
getting whacked in the head by one of these would cause some significant damage to your enemies noggin&rsquo;.
Learnin&rsquo; from this, we&rsquo;ve taken as many bricks as we could find from around our warehouses and given them to our neighbourhood Sniper by the truckload
- now hows that for some southern hospitality! If an enemy gets hit in the head by one of these bad boys from a good way over yonder, the damage inflicted should be mighty painful,
more than enough to cause significant bleedin&rsquo;; That&rsquo;s gotta smart!</p>

<p>This second one I dug out from the scrap heaps myself: A rusty six-shooter, with my name on it (not literally, mind you.)
Now, I think it's been long overdue I get myself a proper piece fit for a Texan, but not just any old skeet shooter will do for this cowpoke.&nbsp;
After some fine craftsmanship from yours truly, this bad boy can have any sorry-ass merc cryin&rsquo; for mama in two shakes of a cow&rsquo;s bell.
Suffice to say, if any self-respectin' cowboy comes across someone with this gun, they better high tail it to the next county over, or pray to god they've got the quicker hand.</p>

<p>Next thing we got here is actually a request from that rat-scoundrel Spy, if y'all can believe it.&nbsp;
Barged into my workshop right &lsquo;round 3 in the morning, covered in scorch marks and waving around that piece he got from some wetwork down in the Amazon demandin&rsquo;
I &ldquo;make &lsquo;zis thing useful&rdquo; - I woulda socked him right there in his snail eatin&rsquo; mouth if it weren&rsquo;t for that damn favor he cashed in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I went and started workin&rsquo; on the knife and wouldn&rsquo;t you know, turns out someone else went to tinkerin&rsquo; with it already - there was a whole mess of circuitry embedded under the carvings.
&nbsp; By patchin&rsquo; it into the power bank of that fancy spytech watch he&rsquo;s got, it should have enough juice to send that sentry sapper flyin&rsquo;
across the battlefield one leap at a time - I reckon that frog&rsquo;s finally got his legs!</p>

<p>And of course I reckon y&rsquo;all wanna hear bout them new arenas to test these new fancy, re-engineered, weapons.&nbsp;
Well, fellas, I got good news - the whole lot of us got deeded a couple of world heritage sites as thanks for preventin&rsquo; the robot apocalypse for the second time in a row - and seein&rsquo;
as conundrums of philosophy just ain&rsquo;t my specialty, I figured it would be best to set em up as exotic new locales for some good ol fashioned roughhousing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I suppose that&rsquo;s that then, see y&rsquo;all out on the battlefield with my new inventions!
Don&rsquo;t forget to suggest any changes in the nearest, sentry guarded, suggestion drop-box. Happy Killin, y&rsquo;all!</p>
