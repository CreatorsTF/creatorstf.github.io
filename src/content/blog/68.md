<p>"This year has been a wild ride hasn't it? But screw it, let's make the rest of the year even bigger!" - That's the topic I brought up to the Mann Co. employees during our latest meeting. One of them suggested to develop two special events at the same time. And you know what happened to him? Yeah, obviously he got fired, ha-ha. I am the boss here, and I make the decisions. Not him. It's me.</p>
<p>Anyway, after thinking for a while, I had a revelation! Let's announce two special themes at the same time, so we can develop two events at the same time! That sounds amazing and totally original! Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>So here we are: introducing two upcoming themes that will be featured in the next major events by Creators.TF till the end of this year: <b>Halloween</b> and <b>Robots</b>. I'm mainly making this announcement to make some noise to help fill our workshop with content. So if you're excited about these upcoming themes, like me, go make stuff for the workshop. Oh, and in case if you already have content in your Steam Workshop that fits one of those themes, your items get bonus points by automatically being eligible to be included in these events! Sounds awesome, doesn't it? Then <a href="" target="_blank">submit your stuff to Creators.TF</a>.</p>
<p>Now some guidelines: for the Halloween-themed events, we are waiting for, obviously, Halloween-themed cosmetics, taunts, weapons. For the Robotic event however, we mainly need content that resembles or is similar to content previously introduced in «Robotic Boogaloo Update»: robotic cosmetics, taunts, weapons, anything!</p>
<p>And also there was a message from Creators.TF team that they really wanted me to announce. Uh, what does it says... "We... need... more...". Yetis? Guns? Pants? Oh, wait, no. "We need more people!", that's what it says. Creators.TF is currently looking for a few more team members to help create these upcoming events, so if you're excited to help - <a href="" target="_blank">apply to the team</a>. Applications will be closed whenever they get enough people, so don't delay!</p>
