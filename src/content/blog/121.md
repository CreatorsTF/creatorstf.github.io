<p>An update for Creators.TF was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Major changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Readded process refresh which was accidentally removed. It is now <i>properly</i> using it's workshop version.</li>
    <li>Tentatively fixed the "double map bug" in end of round votes.</li>
    <li>Updated "pretty map names" to be in lowercase and using a much more maintainable library. This effects the nominations library and the end of map vote.</li>
    <li>Workshop maps are now first in the nominations list</li>
    <li>Removed gscramble and set scramble method back to Valve scramble - gscramble is ancient, massive, and has no real benefits compared to the built in scramble function.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see most of the in depth changes <a href="">here</a>.</p>
