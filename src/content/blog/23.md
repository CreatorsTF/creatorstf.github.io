<p>During the announcement of Half-Life: Alyx, we thought "Let's make a Half-Life themed event!", so that's what we did.</p>

<p>Starting today, we're introducing the <a href='/landing/hazardousenvironments'>Hazardous Environments event!</a> A 4-day event themed around the Half-Life franchise. In this first day, we're showing off our very own in-house made SFM short film, new community-maps to be introduced into the rotation, and a new set of cosmetics themed around, you guessed it, Half-Life!</p>

<p>There have been many hints and teasers of this update, and some people may even say there was an ARG(?) so, if you're even <i>remotely</i> interested in seeing those and much more, you can join us in our official <a href="">Discord server.</a></p>

<p>We very much look forward to working with the community to implement more fun, new, and interesting content in the year of 2020. See you tomorrow for Day 2!</p>

<i>Also, wash your hands!</i>
