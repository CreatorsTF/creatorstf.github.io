<p><i>explosion, big boom sound here Yowza!</i> Did you feel that? That must’ve been an explosion caused by the robots outside our base! We’ve been swamped recently in our recent Mann vs Machine campaign, Operation: Digital Directive. Thank you guys for helping to destroy the horde so far! We’ve seen a great turnout of support and mercenaries willing to put up a good fight.</p>

<p>Now, not everything has been all sunshine and rainbows. Our engineers have been very overworked at the moment and they suggested to me that we recruit more people onto the Creators.TF team. I took one look at them, had a quick laugh, and then threatened to fire them if they didn’t get back to work fixing the bugs... Unfortunately, the actual boss showed up and threatened to fire me if I didn’t give them their special mention.</p>

<p>
