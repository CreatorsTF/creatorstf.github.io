<p>
An update for Creators.TF servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Minor changes include:
	<ul>
		<li>Added hidden attribute +55% melee bounds multiplier to the Hypodermic Injector to better improve teammate hit registration, similar to soldier's Disciplinary Action.</li>
		<li>Ping masking has been disabled on Creators.TF servers.</li>
		<li>Added <i>!seed</i> chat command. Running this command will send an alert in the #looking-for-players channel on our discord to help populate (or "seed") an empty server.</li>
		<li>Removed intel capture crits for Capture the Flag on Alternative Gamemode servers.</li>
	</ul>
