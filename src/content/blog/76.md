<p>Greetings mortals, it is I, Merasmus! Today, I come to you to announce that Creators.TF released their Halloween event, in collaboration with me! I am glad they trusted Merasmus enough to let him prepare Scream Fortress for them. However, Merasmus has to curse Soldier once again, as he sneakily replaced my spoons with his weird ones, because “this is America”.</p>

<p>Merasmus hopes you will like this event, that took some time to produce. Better to release later than to release a forever bad event, you know? By the way, if you meet one of the team members, tell them to give Merasmissions back to Merasmus, or they will face a certain doom!</p>

<a href="/landing/barbocabarto" target="_blank">Go check it out</a>, fool!
