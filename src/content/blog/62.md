<p>An update for Creators.TF servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Notable changes include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sludgepit (Patch notes taken from <a href="https://tf2maps.net/downloads/sludgepit.9164/update?update=25213" target="_blank">Sludgepit's page</a> on TF2maps.net)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed clipping in several areas so players cant build in areas they aren't suppose to and can't get out of bounds.</li>
		<li>Fixed it so red players don't get stuck in their first spawn. If they are in their spawn the same time the spawns switch to the new spawns they will teleport to those spawns.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
