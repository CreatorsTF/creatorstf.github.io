<p>As of today, the new 3D loadout and inventory system are both out of beta! Huge thanks to everyone who helped us during the beta reporting bugs and giving feedbacks, it was really important to the development of all of this.</p>

<p>3D loadout preview: It's now easier for you to preview how your cosmetic will look on your chosen character in-game. Rotate, zoom or move, you can now choose the best angle to see how the nice shiny hat will look on you.</p>

<p>Inventory: No more long scroll downs to see your entire catalog of items, because we now have pages! Specifically, 25 items per page. And also, a "Search" system was added so, if you have a load of items or just wanna find a specific one, you can easily filter what you wanna see -- Yes, you can search for a specific class' name and it will return all the current items of said class in your inventory.</p>
