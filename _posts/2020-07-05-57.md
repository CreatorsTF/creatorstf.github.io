<p>The original <a href="https://youtu.be/dzMq5_thk4o" target="_blank">Team Fabulous 2</a> came out almost a decade ago, yet it has become, and still is, the most iconic and memorable Team Fortress 2 animation to this day. The creator of this video passed away due to leukemia in 2015, but his legacy will be remembered for many years.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://twitter.com/Teamfabulous2R" target="_blank">Team Fabulous 2 Reanimated</a> have taken the initiative to bring the Team Fortress 2 community together to reanimate the video to honor kitty0706 and his inspirational legacy! Featuring over 200 creators, artists and animators, the final fully reanimated video is finally live on YouTube.</p>
<p>Donations can be made to the <a href="https://tiltify.com/@tfconnect/team-fabulous-2-reanimated-charity" target="_blank">Team Fabulous 2 Reanimated Charity</a> to help fight against leukemia. The charity will be online until August 6th, 2020!</p>
<p>Last but not least, as a little collaboration with the TF2R team, we have decided to release a small, yet memorable, gift for everyone who wants to celebrate the release and to tribute our beloved content creator. A new special cosmetic has been added to our <a href="{{site.url}}/store">store</a> that can be purchased right now! We definitely recommend watching this video, so click the button above and we'll see you there!</p>
