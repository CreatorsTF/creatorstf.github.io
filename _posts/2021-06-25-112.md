<p>*grabs microphone* Listen up mercenaries! This is a public service announcement! If you haven’t heard through the Teufort Times, our friends over at TFConnect are holding another charity event:</p> 

<p><b>The Midsummer Mashup! From June 26-27th, TFConnect will be broadcasting from <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/kritzkast' target='_blank'>Kritzkast’s Twitch channel</a> in support of Stop AAPI Hate</b>. Formed in 2020 in response to racist attacks and bigitroy towards people of the Asian community during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Stop AAPI Hate is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to help track and respond to incidents of hate, violence, discrimination, and child bullying against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.</p>

<p>TFConnect is hoping to raise &#36;5,000 for Stop AAPI Hate, and we need your help! Right now you can donate to the event at <a href='https://www.tfconnect.org/donate' target='_blank'>tfconnect.org/donate</a>. Any amount from your wallet would be amazing and it’ll be going towards a great cause.</p>

<p>So what’s happening during these two days you may ask? We’ve got a lot of segments featuring some amazing content creators, interviews, a showcase of <a href='https://openfortress.fun/' target='_blank'>Open Fortress</a>, and lots of fun gameplay with some unwilling participants, some BONK-fueled fun courtesy of <a href='https://www.parkour.tf/' target='_blank'>Parkour.TF</a>, a punch to the face with our good friend Saxton Hale, a game show courtesy of <a href='https://jumpacademy.tf/' target='_blank'>Jump Academy</a>, and so much more!</p>

<p>So please throw your money at your computer monitor, pick it back up, and then use it to <a href='https://www.tfconnect.org/donate' target='_blank'>donate to Stop AAPI Hate</a>. You can tune into the live stream both days at <a href='https://twitch.tv/kritzkast' target='_blank'>twitch.tv/kritzkast</a>, starting at 6:00pm BST, 1:00pm EDT on Saturday, June 26th, and again on Sunday, June 27th. Finally, give TFConnect some love for all of the hard work they’ve done to make this event a reality by supporting their <a href='https://twitter.com/TF_Connect' target='_blank'>twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening, now go support a great cause!</p>
