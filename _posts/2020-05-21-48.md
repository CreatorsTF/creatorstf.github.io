<p>An update for Creators.TF servers was released. Changes will automatically apply after a map change. Notable changes include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A map rating will now appear when a player dies after having at least 5 minutes played on a map</li>
	<li>Summercoast (Patch notes taken from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/1761528829" target="_blank">Summercoast's page</a> on the Steam Workshop)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Gameplay changes:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Added a killing trigger in the closing fence so stuck players will automatically die</li>
				<li>Added a nobuild zone in the closing fence: sentries can no longer clip in the fence</li>
				<li>Added an extra ammopack at C to help engineer build a sentry faster to defend that area</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Visual changes:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Rotated the map so the skybox makes more sense: cart is pushed toward the mountain now</li>
				<li>Tweaked the textures of the cliffs and rocks to make them look like grassy cliffs instead of the snowy blend left from Snowycoast</li>
				<li>Fixed the rotating light at B, now turning red when cart approaches then blue when the point is captured</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
