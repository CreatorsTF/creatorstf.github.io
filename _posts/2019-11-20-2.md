<p>Thank you all very much for your interest and excitement surrounding our project. Right now, we're getting so many requests, we barely have the time to read them all! With that being said, we are glad there are so many.</p>
<p>As we analyzed all of the applications, we realized: "Hey, we're not a company. We are first and foremost.. a community." It wouldn't feel right if we took the assistance of only a few people out of many. Everyone has the right to participate.</p>
<p>That is why we needed a place of communication, somewhere where we can discuss our ideas and concepts. That's right, we're talking about a Discord server. <a href="/discord">Join our Discord</a> server, tell us about yourself, and stay in the know about the project!</p>
