<p><i>screeeeeeeeeeeeech CRASH!</i></p>

<p>Mwahahahaha! It’s me! The blog post writer in a pickle suit! Now you might be wondering: “What the hell was he drinking last night, and did he just crash a car through a wall?”. To answer your questions: Pure ethanol and that crashed car will cost the Creators.TF team 2 gazillion dollars.</p>

<p>The reason why I’ve decided to crash through the wall today is because I have invented a brand new way of fighting other mercenaries out on the battlefield! Introducing… The Dell Pickle! Wait… why aren’t any of you applauding this massive advance in human technology? I’ve spent YEARS working on this concept! I had to learn how to weld, program and go through mental rehab all at the same time! You know what, you people are stupid and uncultred; I’m outta here!</p>

<p>Join me in pursuing this advanced human technology by going to the <a href='/store' target='_blank'>Creators.TF Store</a> to buy yours today! Run quickly now!</p>

<p>Oh crap, I forgot I broke the car... It was Moonly’s fault, not mine!</p>
