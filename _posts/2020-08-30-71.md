<p>Last night, son, I had a weird dream. It’s a long story, so I’ll pass you the details. I was defending one of the many facilities while a man with a chilling voice replaced the usual lady shouting in the speaker. I was fixing my sentry while this man appeared behind me. My first reaction was to equip the Wrangler and shoot at him, but it didn’t do anything! <i>“Mister Conagher…”</i>, he said, <i>“your… toy won’t save you this time”</i>. As he was about to put his hands on my shoulders, I woke up.</p>

<p><i>“Rise and shine, Mr. Conagher.”</i> The man was in my room! Smirking, he reached at his pockets and handed me a tiny thing that looked like speakers and a TV. <i>“Give it to your… employers”</i>, he said. <i>”This is the product they were… waiting for.”</i> Then, he walked out of my room, without a word. I looked at the product more closely, but it didn’t make any sense.</p>

<p>When I got to my employers’ office, the CEO laughed at his colleagues. <i>“Hah, I told y’all we were going to get it some day!”</i> When I asked him what this thing was, his writer handed me this notice:</p>

<p><i>The G-Man Announcer Pack, initially planned to release alongside Hazardous Environments is now available. To use it, download the <a href="{{site.url}}/launcher">Creators.TF Community Launcher</a> and activate the Announcer Pack.<br>Or you can download the <a href="https://fastdl.creators.tf/launcher/announcer/creators_tf_announcer_gman.zip" download>.vpk</a> and put inside your "tf/custom" folder.</i></p>

<p>Son, if you want to use this thing, go ahead, it sure sounds amazing. Me, I’ll pass on that. That night was so terrifying I don’t see myself using it.</p>
