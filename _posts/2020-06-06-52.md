<p>After some anticipation and "leaks", the Creators.TF Workshop is now available in <a href="https://beta.creators.tf/submissions" target="_blank">beta</a>!</p>

<p>This also marks the reopening of our submission system, so if you are a map, cosmetic or weapon creator, you must now <a href="https://beta.creators.tf/submission/create" target="_blank">submit</a> your item through our new custom Workshop. This helps us make sure that what you submit is, well, yours and yours only, and not someone else's work.
<br>This new system also includes an user rating system, so you, the player, can vote on your favorite items to tell us which one you would like to see in our future events!</p>

<p>You probably will see some unfinished stuff there, and that's expected, as this system is in beta, like the inventory and loadout system.</p>

<p>If you want to submit a bug report/feedback/valuable idea for this, you can email us on <a href="mailto:support@creators.tf">support@creators.tf</a>, send us a ticket through <a href="https://support.creators.tf/" target="_blank">support.creators.tf</a> or simply by sending a message on the #feedback channel on our <a href="https://creators.tf/discord" target="_blank">official Discord server</a>.</p>
